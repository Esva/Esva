### Well, Hello There ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris, people call me CJ but I'm also known as Esva from my days of too much gaming and Live Stream content creation on Mixer and now on Twitch. I'm self taught in After Effects, Photoshop, 3D modelling and basic game design using Unreal Engine, but what I really want is to breakout into the Tech world and make a career. So instead of moving from hobby to hobby decided in 2022 to actually do something and take the challenge. So right now I'm a bootcamp student with the School of Code.


- ðŸ”­ School of Code cohort 12 student.
- Hackathon week 1 - Created a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game in basic JS with a little easter egg here and there.
- Hackathon week 2 - Created a dad joke api frontend during our API Hackathon
- Hackathon week 3 - A week of UI/UX with the goal of creating a mock landing page taking all the UX/UI principles in mind and building frameworks.
- Hackathon week 4 - Building a backend server in node.js with express.js
- Hackathon week 5 - --[In Progress]--
